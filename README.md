# SafeDrive
Traffic app for Zimbabwean drivers but can be customised for any location. The app has two main functions which are (i) Drive Mode and (ii) Road status updates. Drive Mode allows the driver to permit the app to automatically inform a caller that they are driving and unable to answer attend to their call. Road status updates allow the driver to view real time updates about the status of road(s) in their location. It provides information like traffic volume, traffic lights status to mention just a few. Note that this project is ot yet complete, Drive mode can only detect incoming calls for now and the road status are available for only two locations, Harare and Bulawayo. These are hard coded as in Zimbabwe there is currently no technology to collect real time data about status of roads and highways. I made use of Firebase and created a database that lists some roads that are found in Harare and Bulawayo.
